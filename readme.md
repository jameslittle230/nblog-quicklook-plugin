# NBLog QuickLook Plugin

The Northern Bites use a custom file format, .nblog, to store robot data. Usually, these are images taken from the robot.

This project is a plugin for QuickLook on macOS: previews of the embedded image will now show up when you interact with the log file in the Finder.

To install, download the project and run it in Xcode. The plugin will install itself into `~/Library/Quicklook` automatically.
